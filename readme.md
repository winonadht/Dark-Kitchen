# ðŸ˜· Dark Kitchen

> Dark kitchens are also known as virtual kitchens, cloud kitchens, ghost kitchens or delivery-only restaurants. However you call it, a dark kitchen always revolves around the same concept: selling meals exclusively through delivery. Ghost kitchens have no sitting capacity for in-house diners or walk-ins, as they focus only on delivery, preparing food once an order comes in through a delivery app or an online ordering system.


- Type of challenge: `consolidation`  
- Duration: `3 days`  

## Learning objectives

Using all that you know about frontend so far to work on real use case.

## The mission

You will be in charge of building a Dark Kitchen online delivery service. The site must a single page website, with the following features. 

- Create a list of dishes that people will order online.
- The website should be responsive, it should work on a standard mobile resolution and on desktop 
- You must list the food using some sort of card templates
- You should categorize your food to be able to filter it (ex: vegan, comfort food)
- You should create a `shopping cart` component to display the selected dishes and display the total amount of the delivery
- You should create a `dark mode` switch, to toggle your design between a `light` and a `dark` mode


## The design

You're not a designer (unless you are). Be a developer, use existing design.
- Use figma community to look for a free "design system" or " UI kit", and use the elements you found to create your website UI.
- Find a design system that would allow you to build the feature required


## Evaluation process 

- One repo per group
- Everyone from the group must contribute ( if you're paircoding, name your pair in the commit message description)
- Every displayed feature must have been created on a branch named per the feature name! 
- You commit often, you push at the end of the day (at the minimum) when your feature is done.
- Merge on dev branch once your feature is done and tested.( ask some feedback on the code before merging (pull request maybe :o ))
- You merge the dev branch with the main branch once you're sure the feature are working together.
- The website must use **semantic HTML**
- Use the power of **SCSS & BEM**
- Use multiple scss file to be able to work in parrallel.
- Be specific in your class names to avoid conflicting with your coworkers classes.
